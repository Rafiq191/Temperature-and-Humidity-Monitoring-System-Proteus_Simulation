Assignment 1: Arduino Based Project

Topic: Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System

Instructions:
Design an Arduino-based temperature and humidity monitoring system using a DHT11 sensor. The system should read the temperature and humidity values from the sensor and display them on a 16x2 LCD screen. Additionally, implement a threshold-based alert mechanism that displays "ALERT!" on the LCD screen when the temperature exceeds a certain value (e.g., 30°C).

Expected Result:
The simulated Arduino should continuously read temperature and humidity values from the DHT11 sensor and display them on the LCD screen. When the temperature exceeds 30°C, the LCD should display "ALERT!".
